I did my job in SimpleScene.py file.
I made some global variables and function catmullRomSpline and function CowDirection.
And I changed some part in function display, onMouseButton and onMouseDrag.
But this code has a problem. After I click 6 points, the cow disappear and after moving, the cow appear again.
